# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Project
Hello! This is my first Machine Learning Project, whose objective is to compute the price of a car. The parameters, which are used to determine the effective price of the car is as follows:

1)Year of the purchase of the car

2)Model of the Car

3)Owner(s)

4)Vehicle Transmission (Automatic/Manual)

5)Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)

6)Seller Type (Dealer/Non-Dealer)

7)Present Ex-Showroom Price

8)Price at which the present owner would like to sell the car

9)Number of kilometers driven

The link for the dataset which I used is: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv

The libraries used in this project: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Scikit-learn

We first compare between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, after which we find that Linear Regression fits the dataset better by a small margin, nevertheless the model can still be optimized to give a better accuracy and to fit the data better.
