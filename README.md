# Car-Price-Prediction-ML-Project
Hello! This is my first Machine Learning Project, whose objective is to compute the price of a car. The parameters, which are used to determine the effective price of the car is as follows:

Year of the purchase of the car
Model of the Car
Owner(s)
Vehicle Transmission (Automatic/Manual)
Fuel Type (Petrol/Diesel/CNG)
Seller Type (Dealer/Non-Dealer)
Present Ex-Showroom Price
Price at which the owner would like to sell the car
Number of kilometers driven
The link for the dataset which I used is: https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho?select=car+data.csv

The libraries used in this project: Numpy,Pandas,Matplotlib,Scikit-learn

We first compare between Linear Regression and Logistic Regression, after which we find that Linear Regression fits the dataset better by a small margin, nevertheless the model can still be optimized to give a better accuracy and to fit the data better.
